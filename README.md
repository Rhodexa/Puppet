# Puppet
Puppet is a dirt-simple multi-axis linear motion with acceleration profile template for embedded system, originally designed for ATmega328, but now centered on 32-bit MCUs (ESP32, STM32, etc), however, it is trivial to set it up to work on the older and ubiquitous ATmegaxx8 family

Puppet is an experimental personal project made for scavengers' 3D Printers and other CNC tools. It is meant to work together with Puppeteer, a desktop app aiming to off-load all the high-level logic of 3D printing, while Puppet focuses on motion control and other critical tasks like homing or temperature control. This allows for really fast prototyping, learning, and opens the door for using pretty much any MCU which has a way of communication with a computer.
